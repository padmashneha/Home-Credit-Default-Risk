# Home Credit Loan Prediction Challenge

## Introduction

Many individuals face challenges in obtaining loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this often leaves them vulnerable to untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit is on a mission to enhance financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure a positive loan experience for this underserved population, Home Credit leverages various alternative data sources, including telco and transactional information, to predict clients' repayment abilities. While Home Credit currently employs statistical and machine learning methods for these predictions, they are inviting Kagglers to contribute and help unlock the full potential of their data. This collaborative effort aims to ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are provided with terms that empower clients to be successful.

## Challenge Objective

The primary goal of this challenge is to optimize the use of alternative data to predict clients' repayment abilities accurately. By doing so, Home Credit aims to minimize rejections for clients capable of repayment and provide loans with suitable principal amounts, maturities, and repayment calendars. The challenge encourages participants to explore innovative approaches, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from the provided data.

## Evaluation Metric

The performance of the models will be evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to discriminate between clients who will repay their loans and those who will not.

## Dataset

The dataset for this challenge consists of eight files, each containing valuable information for predicting clients' repayment abilities. Participants are encouraged to explore and utilize all available data to build robust and accurate models.

## Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Gathering and Research Phase
During this phase, participants should familiarize themselves with the provided dataset and conduct research to understand the nature of the data. This step is crucial for making informed decisions during subsequent stages of the project.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Data Preparation
Cleaning and preparing the data are essential steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset. Participants should address missing values, handle outliers, and transform variables as needed to create a clean and reliable dataset for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves exploring the dataset visually and statistically to gain insights into the relationships between variables. This phase helps participants identify patterns, trends, and potential features that may be crucial for predicting repayment abilities.

### 4. Data Modeling
Participants are encouraged to apply various statistical and machine learning methods to build predictive models. The challenge is to optimize the use of alternative data to enhance the accuracy of predictions and contribute to Home Credit's mission of financial inclusion.

### 5. Evaluation
The final step involves evaluating the performance of the developed models using the Area Under ROC curve metric. Participants should analyze the results and provide insights into the effectiveness of their models in predicting clients' repayment abilities.
